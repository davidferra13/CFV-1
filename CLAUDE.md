# ChefFlow V1 — Project Rules

This file is read by Claude Code at the start of every conversation. These rules are mandatory.

---

## DATA SAFETY (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

These rules exist because this is a **live production app with real client data**. Data loss is unacceptable.

### Database Migrations

- **NEVER** write a migration containing `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` without:
  1. Explicitly warning the user in plain language
  2. Explaining exactly what data would be lost
  3. Getting explicit approval before writing the file
- **NEVER** modify an existing column's type or rename a column without explaining the risk first and getting approval.
- All migrations must be **additive by default** — add tables, add columns, add indexes, add constraints. Removing or altering existing structures requires explicit approval.
- Before creating any migration file, **explain in plain English** what it will do to the database.
- **Show the user the full SQL** before writing the migration file.
- Remind the user to **back up their database** before applying migrations with real data.
- **NEVER** run `supabase db push` or apply migrations without explicit user approval.
- **Before every `supabase db push`**, remind the user to run a backup first:

  ```bash
  supabase db dump --linked > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
  ```

### Migration Timestamp Collisions (CRITICAL — Multi-Agent Safety)

- **Before creating ANY migration file**, you MUST run `glob supabase/migrations/*.sql` to see all existing migration files.
- Pick a timestamp that is **strictly higher** than the highest existing one. For example, if the highest is `20260221000002`, your new file must be `20260221000003` or later.
- **NEVER** reuse or guess a timestamp. Always check first.
- This rule exists because multiple Claude Code agents may run concurrently. Without checking, two agents can generate the same timestamp, causing migration collisions that corrupt the schema.

### Server Actions & Queries

- Never write a `.delete()` query on production tables without explicit approval.
- Respect existing immutability triggers — never attempt to circumvent the immutability on `ledger_entries`, `event_transitions`, or `quote_state_transitions`.

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Making Changes

- **Explain what you're about to do in plain terms** before making changes, especially for anything touching the database, authentication, or financial logic.
- When in doubt, **ask — don't assume**.

### Documentation

- **Always create a follow-up `.md` document for every code change.** Every implementation should have a reflecting document that explains what changed, why, and how it connects to the system. No code-only changes.

### Git Workflow

- Use **feature branches** for new work, not direct commits to `main`.
- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`.
- **NEVER** run `git push`, merge to `main`, or deploy to Vercel unless the user explicitly says so.
- `git commit` is fine. `git push` is not unless told to.

### Feature Close-Out (run when user asks to close out a feature)

Run these in order — stop and report any failure before continuing:

1. `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` → must exit 0
2. `npx next build --no-lint` → must exit 0
3. `git add` relevant files + `git commit` with a clear message
4. Confirm branch is clean and ready — do NOT push or deploy

### Health Checks (run before merging to main)

- `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` → must exit 0, zero errors
- `npx next build --no-lint` → must exit 0
- All work committed, no important untracked files
- `types/database.ts` current with remote schema

### Full Workflow Reference

See **`docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`** for the complete step-by-step playbook covering health checks, migration safety, parallel agent rules, and merge procedure. Every agent should read it before starting significant work.

## IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

These are the four patterns Claude will get wrong without explicit rules.

### 1. Non-Blocking Side Effects

Notifications, emails, activity logs, calendar syncs, and automations are **non-blocking** — if they fail, the main operation still succeeds.

- Always wrap side effects in `try/catch`
- Log failures as warnings, never throw
- The main transaction commits regardless

```ts
// CORRECT
try {
  await sendNotification(...)
} catch (err) {
  console.error('[non-blocking] Notification failed', err)
}

// WRONG — this would roll back the whole operation on notification failure
await sendNotification(...)
```

### 2. Tenant ID Comes From Session — Never From Request Body

Always derive `tenant_id` from the authenticated session, never trust input from the client.

```ts
// CORRECT
const user = await requireChef()
const tenantId = user.tenantId! // from session

// WRONG — attacker can forge this
const tenantId = input.tenantId
```

### 3. Financial State Is Derived, Never Stored

Balances, profit, payment status, and food cost % are **computed from ledger entries** via database views — never written directly to a column.

- Use `event_financial_summary` view for per-event financials
- Use `getTenantFinancialSummary()` for overall totals
- If a number looks wrong, fix the ledger entry — never patch a balance column directly

### 4. UI Component Variants

Only use variants that actually exist — wrong variants fail silently or throw.

| Component  | Allowed variants                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `<Button>` | `primary`, `secondary`, `danger`, `ghost`        |
| `<Badge>`  | `default`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `info` |

`outline`, `default` (Button), `warning` (Button), `success` (Button) do **not** exist.

## ARCHITECTURE REMINDERS

These are the established patterns. Follow them — don't reinvent.

### Private AI — Local Only (NO Exceptions)

**Private data must never leave the local machine.** Any function that handles client PII, financials, allergies, messages, or internal business data uses `parseWithOllama` — not `parseWithAI`.

- `parseWithOllama` now throws `OllamaOfflineError` if Ollama is not running. It **never** falls back to Gemini.
- **Never** add `parseWithAI` as a fallback in any file that calls `parseWithOllama`.
- If Ollama is offline, the feature hard-fails with a clear error. The user sees "Start Ollama to use this feature." Data is not leaked.
- The `OllamaOfflineError` class lives in `lib/ai/ollama-errors.ts` (no `'use server'` — class exports are not allowed in server action files). Import it from there: `import { OllamaOfflineError } from '@/lib/ai/ollama-errors'`. Callers that catch errors **must** re-throw it: `if (err instanceof OllamaOfflineError) throw err`.
- Heuristic/regex fallbacks (no LLM call) are acceptable — they don't send data externally.

Private data categories that must stay local:

- Client names, contact info, dietary restrictions, allergies, messages
- Budget amounts, quotes, payment history, revenue, expenses
- Business analytics, insights, lead scores, pricing history
- Temperature logs, staff data, event operational details

- **Server actions** with `'use server'` for all business logic
- **Role checks** via `requireChef()`, `requireClient()`, `requireAuth()`
- **Tenant scoping** on every database query — no exceptions
- **`user_roles` table** is the single source of truth for role assignment
  - Uses `entity_id` (not `client_id`) and `auth_user_id` (not `user_id`)
- **All monetary amounts in cents** (minor units, integers)
- **Ledger-first financial model** — immutable, append-only, computed balances
- **8-state event FSM:** draft → proposed → accepted → paid → confirmed → in_progress → completed | cancelled
- **`types/database.ts`** is auto-generated — never manually edit it

## DATABASE

- No local Supabase (no Docker) — use remote with `--linked` flag
- Project ID: `luefkpakzvxcsqroxyhz`
- Cross-layer columns added via `ALTER TABLE` (e.g., Layer 3 adds columns to `clients`)
